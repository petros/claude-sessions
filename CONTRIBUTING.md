# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project. It's people like you that make this such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.

This is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our
community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or
blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature
requests or writing code.

### What we are NOT looking for

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. Instead, use
[discussions](https://github.com/petros/claude-sessions/discussions). If you
have a question specific to the Claude Code, please consider checking their
[website](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code).

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

- https://github.com/petros/claude-sessions/labels/good%20first%20issue - Beginner friendly issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- https://github.com/petros/claude-sessions/labels/help%20wanted - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request)

You can also check [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com)

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
